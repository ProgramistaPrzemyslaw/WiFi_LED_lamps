# WiFi_LED_lamps

### Code
Project is inspired with [https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-rgb-led-strip-web-server/]. I added two buttons for warm and cold LED strips and made my own PCB.

### Schematic
Schematic is not my best, but for a such small and quick project I think it's good enough.

### PCB and components
PCB was milled on my DIY CNC mill, therefore design rules were set to ensure highest PCB yield.
